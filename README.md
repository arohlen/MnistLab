# MnistLab
A lab for creating, training, and testing a neural network in Keras.

## Onboarding

Install the latest Python 3 version.

Run these commands to install the needed packages:

* pip3 install keras
* pip3 install pygame
* pip3 install matplotlib
* pip3 install pickle

I recommmend using VSCode with the Jupyter Notebook extension for the lab, but you can install Jupyter Notebook and run it in the browser if you want.

## Testing the network

To use the draw app to test the network, type this command into the terminal:

* python3 draw_app.py

Press c to clear the screen and if the app doesn't predict your image, press s.
